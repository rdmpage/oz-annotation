<p>R E S E A R C H </p><p>Open Access </p><p>Six new species of Begonia (Begoniaceae) from <br/>limestone areas in Northern Vietnam </p><p>Ching-I Peng <br/>1* , Che-Wei Lin <br/>2 , Hsun-An Yang </p><p>1 </p><p>, Yoshiko Kono <br/>1 and Hieu Quang Nguyen </p><p>3 </p><p>Abstract </p><p>Background: Species of Begonia are richly represented in limestone karst areas across the Sino-Vietnamese border. <br/>More than one hundred species were known, many of which were documented recently. </p><p>Results: In continuation of our systematic studies of Asian Begonia, we report six species of Begonia that are <br/>unknown to science, namely B. caobangensis [sect. Platycentrum], B. circularis, B. melanobullata, B. langsonensis, B.locii <br/>and B. montaniformis [sect. Coelocentrum] from Northern Vietnam. Diagnostic features that separate them from <br/>morphologically allied species are provided. Somatic chromosome numbers were determined, which supports their <br/>placement in the respective sections. Foliar SEM microphotographs were taken and described. <br/>Conclusion: A careful study of the literature, herbarium specimens and living plants, both in the wild and in <br/>cultivation in the experimental greenhouse, supports the recognition of the six new species, which are described <br/>and illustrated. </p><p>Keywords: Begonia caobangensis; Begonia circularis; Begonia melanobullata; Begonia langsonensis; Begonia locii; <br/>Begonia montaniformis; Limestone; New species; sect. Coelocentrum; sect. Platycentrum,Vietnam </p><p>Background </p><p>Begonia sect. Coelocentrum is richly represented in lime- <br/>stone karst areas across the Sino-Vietnamese border re- <br/>gion, comprising more than 60 species (Peng et al. 2014a, <br/>Chung et al. 2014). Nearly half of the species in sect. <br/>Coelocentrum were discovered in the past decade (Chung <br/>et al., 2014; Peng et al. 2013, 2014a), mostly from southern <br/>China. The area from South China to North Vietnam <br/>harbors very high levels of biodiversity (Sodhi et al. 2004). <br/>Recently, Averyanov and Nguyen (2012) documented ten <br/>new species of Begonia from Vietnam and one new spe- <br/>cies from Laos. They also estimated the total actual num- <br/>ber of Begonia species in eastern Indochina to be 180–200 <br/>species. It seems reasonable to speculate that there are <br/>more species of Begonia sect. Coelocentrum to be discov- <br/>ered in the future. In this study we report five new species <br/>of sect. Coelocentrum from Vietnam, some with very <br/>handsome maculation pattern and/or attractive leaf <br/>texture and an unusual new species of sect. Platycentrum <br/>with lanceolate and symmetric leaves. Detailed morpho </p><p>logical descriptions, line drawings, color plates and foliar <br/>SEM microphotographs are provided, and chromosome <br/>numbers are reported. </p><p>Methods </p><p>Chromosome preparations </p><p>Somatic chromosomes were studied for plants of Begonia <br/>caobangensis (Peng 23895, HAST), B. circularis (Peng <br/>22610, HAST), B. melanobullata (Peng 22609, HAST), B. <br/>langsonensis (Peng 21946, HAST), B. locii (Peng 21943, <br/>HAST) and B. montaniformis (Peng 24609, 24610, 24613, <br/>HAST) using root tips. The procedures of pretreatment, <br/>fixation, and staining for chromosome observations were <br/>described in our previous paper (Peng et al. 2014b). Clas- <br/>sification of the chromosome complements based on <br/>centromere position at mitotic metaphase followed Levan <br/>et al. (1964). Voucher specimens of all new species were <br/>deposited in the Herbarium of the Biodiversity Research <br/>Center, Academia Sinica (HAST). </p><p>Cryo scanning electron microscopy </p><p>Fresh leaves of Begonia caobangensis, B. circularis, B. <br/>melanobullata, B. langsonensis, B. locii and B. montani- <br/>formis were dissected and attached to a stub.

Situated among <br/>limestone mountains, near the border of Vietnam and <br/>China. Growing on soil slope in evergreen broad-leaved <br/>forest, in light shade, at ca.1,000 m in elevation (Mary <br/>Sizemore, pers. comm.). Begonia caobangensis occurs also <br/>in Tuyen Quang province (Trinh Ngoc Bon, pers. comm.), <br/>which is adjacent to the southwest border of Cao Bang. </p><p>Etymology </p><p>The specific epithet refers to the locality of the type <br/>collection. </p><p>Notes </p><p>Begonia caobangensis resembles B. aequilateralis Irmsch., <br/>also a member of sect. Platycentrum, in having symmetric <br/>and elliptic leaves. However, B. caobangensis is markedly <br/>distinct in many other features such as blade base de- <br/>current (vs. obtuse to cuneate), narrowly winged (vs. <br/>not winged) petiole, presence (vs. lacking) of the succu- <br/>lent bristles at tips of ovary wings and pistillate tepals 6 </p><p>(vs. 5). A comparison of the two species is presented in <br/>Table 1. The combination of symmetric leaves, 6- <br/>tepalled pistillate flowers and the succulent bristles at <br/>tips of ovary wings make it a unique species in sect. <br/>Platycentrum. </p><p>Figure 3 Distribution map of Begonia caobangensis (open circle), B. <br/>circularis (Inverted solid triangle), B. langsonensis (open triangle), B. locii <br/>(solid circle), B. melanobullata (square) and B. montaniformis (star) in <br/>Northern Vietnam. </p><p>Table 1 Comparison of Begonia caobangensis and <br/>B. aequilateralis </p><p>B. caobangensis <br/>B. aequilateralis </p><p>Stipule </p><p>Size (cm) <br/>2–2.5 × 0.7–1 <br/>1 × 0.3 </p><p>Petiole <br/>Narrowly winged <br/>Not winged </p><p>Leaf </p><p>Base <br/>Decurrent <br/>Obtuse to cuneate </p><p>Staminate flower </p><p>Tepal size (mm) <br/>Outer 10–12 × 4–8, <br/>inner 7–15 × 2–6 </p><p>Outer 12–18 × 10–17, <br/>inner 13–16 × 6–8 </p><p>Pistillate flower </p><p>Tepal number <br/>6 <br/>5 </p><p>Tepal size (mm) <br/>Outer 8–14 × 6–9, inner <br/>9–18 × 4–6.5 </p><p>Outer 13–17 × 5–7.5, <br/>inner 10–14 × 5–7 </p><p>Ovary size, wings <br/>excluded (mm) </p><p>12–15 × 4–5 <br/>Ca. 8 × 3 </p><p>Wings on ovary <br/>body </p><p>Lateral wings 5.5–8 mm <br/>wide, abaxial wing <br/>10–13 mm wide </p><p>Lateral wings ca. 4 mm <br/>wide, abaxial wing ca. <br/>7 mm wide </p><p>Tip of wings <br/>With succulent bristles Glabrous </p><p>Distribution <br/>Northern Vietnam <br/>Malay peninsula </p><p>Peng et al.

Botanical Studies (2015) 56:9 <br/>Page 19 of 23 </p><p>The holotype (Peng 24609) and one of the paratypes <br/>(Peng 24613) had 2n = 30, which is the prevalent <br/>chromosome number for members of sect. Coelocen- <br/>trum. However, another collection (Peng 24610) showed <br/>aneuploidy with 2n = 30, 31, 32, 33 in different individ- <br/>uals. The aneuploids shared chromosomal features in <br/>common in the respective chromosome complements: <br/>The first two chromosomes were relatively longer, about <br/>1.8–2.0 μm (arrows in Figures A-D; Nos. 1, 2 in Figures <br/>E-H), and the rest were shorter, about 1.0-1.5 μm long. <br/>The two longest chromosomes were clearly metacentric, <br/>however, the centromere positions of most other chro- <br/>mosomes could not be determined. Satellites were not <br/>observed. <br/>To sum up, the chromosome number 2n = 22 for B. <br/>caobangensis agrees with those of the majority species <br/>delimited in Asian section Platycentrum (Y. Kono and <br/>C.-I Peng, unpublished data). The chromosome count of </p><p>2n = 30 in four species (Begonia circularis, B. melanobul- <br/>lata, B. langsonensis, B. locii) of sect. Coelocentrum is <br/>consistent with previous studies on members in this sec- <br/>tion (Peng et al. 2013, 2014a). Unexpected aneuploid <br/>chromosome numbers (2n = 30, 31, 32, 33) however <br/>were observed in B. montaniformis. A review of litera- <br/>ture revealed that aneuploidy was documented in several <br/>species of Begonia, e.g. B. formosana (2n = 60, 64: <br/>Oginuma and Peng, 2002); B. longipetiolata (2n = 34, 36, <br/>38, 71–73: Arends, 1992). </p><p>Leaf anatomy and vestiture </p><p>1.
